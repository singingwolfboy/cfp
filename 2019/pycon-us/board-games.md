# Title

Play Together, Stay Together: Stronger Teams with Board Games

# Description

Tech companies are notorious for churning employees: many people don't stay
at a company for longer than two years. How do you convince people to stick
around and grow a strong team-based culture? Social connections are important,
but many developers are introverts, and don't enjoy booze-fueled parties.

Board games have seen a resurgence in the past few years, and this new breed
of games is much more engaging and varied than "Monopoly" and "Sorry".
Board games can provide a simple framework to promote communication and
social connection, in a way that is much more comfortable for introverts.
Some board games are even cooperative, where the players to work together
towards a common goal -- training the same social skills you need to be
successful in real life.

In this talk, you'll learn how to introduce board games to your
organization, and how you can use them to forge social connections
with your team. We'll also go over some game recommendations,
including what kind of personality would enjoy each game.

# Who and Why

Writing code is easy; leading people is hard. This talk is for anyone who
works with people rather than code, or anyone who wants to do so.

By the end of the talk, I expect that the audience will have some new ideas
about how to promote social connections within their organization. I hope
that some of them will explore the board game recommendations from the talk,
start gaming groups at their organizations, and make tech a friendlier,
more social, and less alcohol-filled place.
