Sending Email with React

# Description

Rendering templates is slow, and sending transactional email means rendering a LOT of templates. At Impraise, we built a system to handle rendering and sending email templates using AWS Lambda and server-side React. Now, our backend can simply call an API, and let Lambda handle the complicated part. Check out how we did it, and how you can offload expensive rendering processes to Lambda as well.
