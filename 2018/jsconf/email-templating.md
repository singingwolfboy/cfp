# Title

Sending Email with React

# Presentation Summary

Rendering templates is slow, and sending transactional email means rendering a LOT of templates. At Impraise, we built a system to handle rendering and sending email templates using AWS Lambda and server-side React. Now, our backend can simply call an API, and let Lambda handle the complicated part. Check out how we did it, and how you can offload expensive rendering processes to Lambda as well.

# What else do you want to tell us about the talk?

This system is running in production today, and we plan to make it open source. It is built on the Apex framework, using continuous deployment via CircleCI. I plan to talk about both the benefits we've seen from using this framework, and the problems we've run into. I'll also talk about automated testing our email templates, and localizing dates and times for email recipients.
