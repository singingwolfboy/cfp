Sending Email with React

# Talk

Rendering templates is slow, and sending transactional email means rendering a LOT of templates. At Impraise, we built a system to handle rendering and sending email templates using AWS Lambda and server-side React. Now, our backend can simply call an API, and let Lambda handle the complicated part. Check out how we did it, and how you can offload expensive rendering processes to Lambda as well.

# How is your talk relevant to this audience?

Sending email notifications is a common task for many websites. This talk presents an innovative way to render these email notifications: both a nod to the title of the conference, and a practical framework that the audience will be able to use right away.

# What interests you about speaking at Render 2018?

I enjoy speaking at tech conferences, and I have a lot of experience doing so. This will be my first presentation at a front-end development conference. I think Render would be a great way to dive into this new audience! Also, I've never been to Oxford, and I'd love to explore the city.
